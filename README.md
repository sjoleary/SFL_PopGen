Research compendium for "**Disentangling spatial, environmental, and demographic signals in population genomics of an exploited, estuarine-dependent flatfish.**"

Raw reads underlying analysis available from short read archive (SRA): BioProject [PRJNA754841](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/754841).

Extended methods and results can be found in:

* `Genotyping.Rmd`: Contains details for read mapping, SNP calling, VCF filtering, and haplotyping of genomic data set used for analysis; the final genotyped file `data/POPGEN/SFL.tidy.genotypes` is too large to be uploaded to github, it is in a zipped folder (`data/POPGEN/SFL.tidy`).
* `Analysis_SFL_PopGen.Rmd`: Contains fully reproducible analysis (code + supplementary figures and tables) described as described in the paper

knitted html files for both analysis are included for easier viewing.

*All necessary custom scripts & functions can be found in* `/scr`.
